   <!-- For all events, return the name, description, location, schedule, start date, start time, registration deadline, and a button to register for that event 
    which will show "you are registered (or something)" if you already registered, and will instead give you a new button to unregister. 
    If the number of registered people is equal to or greater that event capacity show "This event is fully booked (or something)"
    Consider including the event capacity -->
